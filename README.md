# turtlebot3_obstacle_avoidance_project
This repository implements an obstacle avoidance algorithm using ROS2 Humble and a TurtleBot in Gazebo. The robot navigates using LIDAR data to avoid obstacles, with options for path-following. The algorithm runs within a Docker image, ensuring cross-platform compatibility.
